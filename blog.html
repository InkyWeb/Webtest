<p>DISCLAIMER OOOH OOH, this might be just a place for me to scream thoughts and close the lid, don't expect much happiness from this as it might be just me throwing out fleeting thoughts and trying to move on. From myself, to, uh, sort of myself, feeling like I'm heard out even if I'm not telling people things to their face for my own "selfish" reasons, without really telling anyone somewhat helps letting go of things, I think, still experimenting, but yeah, I'll be typing here, probably

<p> This might be a blog where I'll just, talk, a little more than on twitter, this might be a mistake, or something liberating, time will tell, don't expect much of the happy rambling and mindless thoughts, that's for my twitter, maybe

<p> Today's been pretty dull aside of making a website (the bare fuckin shell lol), constant passive aggressiveness from a friend, a lot of idleness/boredom, no much will to do really much, nor much interest, a little lonely, etc, etc, some things didn't went right, but that's alright, listening to music helps a lot, somehow, been listening to a lot of spanish music, a little change, finally listening to music on my native language aside of what people listen here or when outside, and etc, fun
